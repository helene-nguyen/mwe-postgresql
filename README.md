# MWE PostgreSQL RDBSM üêò 

## Introduction

You already how much I love playing with PostgreSQL ... No ? 

You can find here some personnal minimal working example (MWE) that I share, testing PostgreSQL features !

## How to use 

If you want to also run SQL queries :

- Clone the repository

- Download PostgreSQL last version on official website on download page [Postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Once you have it, 2 choices : 

    - Launch the whole file
    - Or copy/paste steps from the file to do it step by step

On Linux :

```sh
sudo -iu postgres -p [PORT] -f /path/to/the/file
``` 

On Windows :


```sh
psql -U postgres -p [PORT] -f /path/to/the/file
```

## Enjoy !
